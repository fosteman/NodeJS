This section of the repo is dedicated to various design patterns for Javascript.

Traditional GoF design patterns can be applied to dynamically typed JavaScript and, in particular, to the Node.js philosophy

Factory can greatly improve the flexibility of our code

Proxy, Decorator, and Adapter - manipulate, extend and adapt object interfaces

Strategy, State, and Template - split complex logic in static and variable components, imvroving code reusability and extensibility

Middleware is great for RESTful APIs and any sort of pipeline processing. It is extensible and elegant paradigm for onion-like structures.

New, JavaScript oriented patterns: Revealing constructor and Composable factory function deal with peculiarities of JS: Async and prototype-based programming.

The idea behind studying patterns is to build reusable code, to enable collaborative software development in vastness of Node.js conventions. The blueprint and guidelines, ideas behind patterns, solidify conventions and chains of reasoning for rapid and truly professional software development.
